# AI Website Builder

## Overview

AI Website Builder is a full-stack web application that allows users to instantly generate, customize, and edit modern, responsive websites for various business types using AI. The platform leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create production-ready HTML, Bootstrap-based designs, and even generates custom images (AI or manual upload) for your site. It supports editing, color palette customization, and accessibility best practices.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Website Generation**: Instantly create a complete, mobile-friendly website for your business (restaurant, logistics, professional services, or custom) by answering a guided form.
- **Business-Type Templates**: Each business type has tailored questions and design templates for relevant, high-converting layouts.
- **Simplicity In Customization**: Customize layouts, colors, and content with an intuitive interface.
- **AI & Manual Image Integration**: Generate images with AI based on your instructions, or upload your own. Images are automatically integrated into the generated site.
- **Preview & Editing**: Instantly preview your site. Use the visual editor to select and edit any element, with both direct and AI-assisted editing modes.
- **Color Palette Customization**: Choose or generate harmonious color schemes, with validation for accessibility and brand appropriateness.
- **SEO & Performance Optimized**: All sites include semantic HTML, meta tags, Open Graph/Twitter cards, and are optimized for speed and search engines.
- **Accessibility First**: Generated sites comply with WCAG standards for inclusivity.
- **Download & Share**: Download your site as a standalone HTML file or share it directly.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and profile management via NextAuth.
- **Version Control for Generated Sites**: Automatically saves generated sites in versioned folders for easy access and updates.

## How It Works

1. **Select Business Type**: Choose from Restaurant, Logistics or Professional Services.
2. **Answer Guided Questions**: Fill out a dynamic form tailored to your business type (name, services, specialties, etc.).
3. **Choose Image Source**: Select AI-generated images (describe what you want), upload your own, or opt for a text-only site.
4. **Customize Colors**: Pick a color scheme or let the AI suggest harmonious palettes.
5. **Generate Website**: The AI creates a complete, production-ready website with your content, images, and branding.
6. **Preview & Edit**: Instantly preview your site. Use the visual editor to select and edit any element (text, images, styles) directly or with AI help.
7. **Save & Download**: Save your generated site for future edits or download it as a standalone HTML package.
